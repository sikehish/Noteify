# Noteify
A note taking app, with a simple goal of making users more productive. This is created using using ReactJS + TypeScript(Intellisense assistant) using Vite(as opposed to CRA)
I've used NodeJS(Express) on server side and MongoDB for DB. Tailwind  CSS with a touch of external css wherever required.

Goals ahead: 
1) To create a study timer(similar to pomodoro timer) and integrate it with Noteify.
2) Inlcude labels feature for the notes, and also bring in textformatting options

Ping me up if you'd want to contribute :)
