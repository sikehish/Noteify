# Noteify
A note taking app, with a simple goal of making users more productive. This is created using using ReactJS + TypeScript(Intellisense assistant) using Vite(as opposed to CRA)
I've used NodeJS(Express) on server side and MongoDB for DB. Tailwind CSS for the UI with a touch of external css wherever required.

Goals ahead: 
1) To create a study timer(similar to pomodoro timer) and integrate it with Noteify.
2) Include labels feature for the notes, and also bring in text formatting options.
3) Implement pagination for notes
4) Responsiveness

Ping me up if you'd want to contribute :)
